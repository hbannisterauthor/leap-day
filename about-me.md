# birth
Technically an 80's kid, but truly a child of the 90's. I was born in sunny San Diego, CA and moved to South Florida shortly after. It was in Florida, among the whipping winds of hurricanes and the gnawing teeth of bath salt-zombies that I spent all of my formative years.

It is, perhaps, for this reason that my novels cut to the very quick of the coeur Americaine.
